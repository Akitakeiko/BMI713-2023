# Problem Set #5

## Submission Instructions 
You will be submitting this assignment as a Group Assignment via GitHub Classroom. Your submission will be recorded when you or your partner push a commit to your group repository on GitHub Classroom (instructions below), and you can make as many commits as you want before the deadline. If you are working on this assignment without a partner, you should still make a group of 1 on GitHub Classroom. We will grade assignments based on the latest commit.

### How to commit code to GitHub

1.  Open either GitHub Desktop or a command line terminal and navigate to the repository that contains this assignment (via the GUI or cd command)
2.  Add the new or modified files to the staging area by either checking the box next to the files or using the command "git add \<filename(s)\>"
3.  Commit the changes. You are required to include a commit message. This is found in the small text box near the commit button on GitHub Desktop or using the command "git commit -m 'commit message goes here'"
4.  Push your changes and files to the remote repository. This is done by pressing the push to origin button on GitHub Classroom or with the command "git push"

**Reminder**: If you are working on this assignment with a partner, you will both be editing the same files in GitHub. We expect to see at least one commit pushed to the remote repo from each member of the team, reflecting your contributions. Remember to pull your teammate's edits to your local computer before editing files. Communicate with each other to make sure you don't overwrite each other's work.

## What to Submit
You will need to submit both an R Markdown file and a knitted HTML or PDF for this assignment. When you finish the assignment, make sure to press the arrow next to the "Knit" button near the top panel of RStudio and select the option to knit to HTML or PDF. Make sure the new HTML or PDF appears in your repository and then follow the steps to commit and push to GitHub Classroom.
