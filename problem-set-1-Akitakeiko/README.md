# Problem Set #1

## Submission Instructions 
You will be submitting this assignment via GitHub Classroom. Your submission will be recorded when you push a commit to the repository on GitHub Classroom (instructions below), and you can make as many commits as you like before the deadline. We will grade assignments based on the latest commit.

### How to commit code to GitHub

1.  Open either GitHub Desktop or a command line terminal and navigate to the repository that contains this assignment (via the GUI or cd command)
2.  Add the new or modified files to the staging area by either checking the box next to the files or using the command "git add \<filename(s)\>"
3.  Commit the changes. You are required to include a commit message. This is found in the small text box near the commit button on GitHub Desktop or using the command "git commit -m 'text goes here'"
4.  Push your changes and files to the remote repository. This is done by pressing the push to origin button on GitHub Classroom or with the command "git push"

## What to Submit
You will need to submit both an R Markdown file and a knitted HTML or PDF for this assignment. When you finish the assignment, make sure to press the arrow next to the "Knit" button near the top panel of RStudio and select the option to knit to HTML or PDF. Make sure the new HTML or PDF appears in your repository and then follow the steps to commit and push to GitHub Classroom.
